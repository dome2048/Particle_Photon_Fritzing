# Particle Photon SMD

This is an updated Fritzing part based on Particleâ€™s guidelines for mounting a Photon board directly to a custom PCB without headers. This arrangement adds pads for the SMPS, Reset, and Setup buttons, USB D+ and D-, and the three colors of the RGB LED.

Tweaks and fixes will be implemented as I have time.
